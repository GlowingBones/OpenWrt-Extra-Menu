Follow these steps to set up your GitHub repository for the LuCI 3rd Party menu.

1. Create the repository
------------------------
1) On GitHub, create a new repository. Example name:
   luci-3rdparty-menu

2) Clone it to your PC:
   git clone https://github.com/<yourname>/luci-3rdparty-menu.git
   cd luci-3rdparty-menu


2. Place the files in the repo
------------------------------
You already have these files from ChatGPT:

- thirdparty.lua
- README.md
- OpenWrt_3rdParty_Menu_Instructions.txt

Do this from inside the repo directory on your PC:

1) Create the directory structure:

   mkdir -p usr/lib/lua/luci/controller

2) Put the lua file in place:

   mv /path/to/thirdparty.lua usr/lib/lua/luci/controller/thirdparty.lua

3) Put the README.md in the repo root (same level as usr/):

   mv /path/to/README.md README.md

4) (Optional) Put the extra user instructions somewhere, for example docs/:

   mkdir -p docs
   mv /path/to/OpenWrt_3rdParty_Menu_Instructions.txt docs/

Your repo layout should look like this:

  luci-3rdparty-menu/
    README.md
    usr/
      lib/
        lua/
          luci/
            controller/
              thirdparty.lua
    docs/
      OpenWrt_3rdParty_Menu_Instructions.txt


3. Commit and push
------------------
From inside the repo:

   git add README.md usr docs
   git commit -m "Initial commit: LuCI 3rd Party menu for Transmission and PGP"
   git push


4. How users install from your repo
-----------------------------------
In README.md, the basic install sequence is:

   # On your PC, from inside the cloned repo
   scp usr/lib/lua/luci/controller/thirdparty.lua root@<router-ip>:/usr/lib/lua/luci/controller/

   # On the router
   rm -f /tmp/luci-indexcache
   rm -rf /tmp/luci-modulecache
   /etc/init.d/rpcd restart
   /etc/init.d/uhttpd restart

After that, LuCI will show:
- a top level "3rd Party" menu
- a "Transmission" item
- a "PGP Tools" item

Clicking:

  3rd Party -> Transmission
    http://<router-ip>:9091/transmission/web/

  3rd Party -> PGP Tools
    http://<router-ip>/pgp/


5. Optional: add a LICENSE file
-------------------------------
If you want other people to reuse this easily, add a license file, for example MIT:

   echo "MIT License" > LICENSE
   git add LICENSE
   git commit -m "Add license"
   git push

That is all you need for a clean, usable GitHub repository that matches your current setup.
